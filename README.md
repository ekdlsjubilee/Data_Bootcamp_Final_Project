Project Description

Crowdfunding platforms have increased in popularity for financially supporting innovative project ideas. The efficiency of these sites, however, would most likely depend on factors such as category, length of name, funding goal, etc.

So, with these factors, we attempt to compare successful and failed Kickstarter campaigns in the United States over the period from 2010 until the end of 2016. In our analysis of Kickstarter's historical data, we strive to identify the key elements that could help a crowdfunding campaign to become successful. Our findings would potentially serve as a guide to maximize the likelihood of a campaign's success for both new and experienced crowdfunding campaign managers.

This project explores the following question:

How do different factors of a project lead to its success/failure? Do these factors have a common pattern we can recognize and utlize to predict the likelihood of a project's success?

For the sake of clarity, we define the "success" of a project by the percentage of funding received. A successful campaign would be one that received at least 100% of its goal.
